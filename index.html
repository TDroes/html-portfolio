    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I describe myself as a flexible and 
        inquisitive person who is very 
        easy to deal with other people. It 
        gives me satisfaction to 
        persevere with every challenge 
        until I reach my goals. I also think 
        it is important to keep 
        developing myself and to take on 
        new challenges.
